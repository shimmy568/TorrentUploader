# Torrent Uploader

A program that will allow for a user to upload torrents to it via a web interface. Could be used for someone running a media server to allow their users to add shows that they want without having full access to the torrent software on the server. 

To make this site I used a node.js backend with handlebars and bootstrap for the frontend. I decided to go with server-side rendering since it was easier to implement in a short period of time for a project this small.
